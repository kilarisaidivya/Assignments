Objects: All JavaScript values except for primitives are objects.
       
Objects are variables to. But objects contain many values.
There is no index value for Objects.
We have keys and values. Javascript object is a collection of named values.

Example: let test = {
                      name : "abc";
                      age : 63;
                      city : "Hyd";
 			    phone :[1234567, 56789];
                     };


Dot operator : console.log(test.name); o/p: abc

Of operator : console.log(test["name"]);

Javascript objects are mutable. They are addressed by reference not by value.
